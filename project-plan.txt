Display Book Details: Expand your book items from just a string to an object containing properties like 'title', 'author', 'publication date', etc. Then create a new component to display the details of a selected book.

Form to Add Books: Create a form to add new books to your list. This will require understanding of Angular's reactive forms or template-driven forms.

Edit and Delete Books: Add the functionality to edit a book's details or delete a book from the list.

Searching and Sorting: Implement a search feature to filter books by title or author. You could also add functionality to sort books based on different properties like publication date or title.

Routing: Implement Angular's routing to navigate between different views or components, such as a 'home' view, a 'book details' view, and an 'add book' view.

User Authentication: Add a login system so users must authenticate before they can add, edit, or delete books. This is a complex feature that involves understanding of Angular's guards and how to interact with backend authentication and authorization.

Integration with a Real Backend: Up until now, you could be working with an in-memory data service or a hardcoded list of books. Now, replace this with a real backend. You could create a simple backend using Node.js and Express, or use a backend-as-a-service platform like Firebase.

State Management: For complex applications, you might need a state management solution to manage and share state across components. Look into solutions like NgRx or NgXS.
